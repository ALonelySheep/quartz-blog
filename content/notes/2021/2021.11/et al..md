    And others; to complete a list, especially of persons, as authors of a published work.


- From Latin, abbreviation of et aliī (“and others”)

## Usage notes
- Formally preferred by some over `etc.` for lists of people in all contexts, reserving etc. for lists of things (inanimate objects); the distinction is sometimes ignored in casual use, and the two abbreviations are used synonymously in many contexts for completing lists except in very careful or formal use. However, in lists of authors of a published work, et al. is still regularly used.
