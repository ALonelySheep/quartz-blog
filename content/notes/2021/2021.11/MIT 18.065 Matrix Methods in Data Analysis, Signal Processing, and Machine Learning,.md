- 学习这门课的主要动力是线性代数的知识在大二的一年内已经有所遗忘了, 并且在学习机器学习期间常常设计线性代数与矩阵的相关知识, 所以想要有针对性地深入学习与复习一下.
	- 也想体验一下Gilbert Strang的课堂
 
 > (Gilbert Strang, during class)
 > "This is what I want to say the most, and I say it to every class I teach near the start of the semester. My feeling about my job is to teach you things, or to join with you in learning things, as has happened today. It's not to grade you."
