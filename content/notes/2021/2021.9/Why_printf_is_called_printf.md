## What f stands for in `printf` ?

The title of section **_7.3 Formatted output - printf_** on page 145 of original K&R strongly suggest that the `f` stands for formatted:

Searching in other sources will show that B's and C's `printf` [both seem to originate from BCPL's `writef` function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printf_format_string#1960s:_BCPL.2C_ALGOL_68.2C_Multics_PL.2FI) which used already in 1966 the `%` formatting character.

Also worth to note that Algol68 also adopted `printf` function for formatted output. Yet the formatting logic was a little different.
