In law and government, de facto (/deɪ ˈfæktoʊ, di-, də-/ day FAK-toh, dee -⁠; Latin: de facto [deː ˈfaktoː], "in fact") describes practices that exist in reality, even though they are not officially recognized by laws.

It is commonly used to refer to what happens in practice, in contrast with de jure ("by law"), which refers to things that happen according to law.
