## What is unsupervised learning?
In Unsupervised Learning, we're given data that looks different than data that looks like this that doesn't have any labels or that all has the same label or really no labels.
监督学习不需要给机器正确答案, 机器会自动找出规律

## What topics does unsupervised learning include?
### Clustering
在一组数据里面找出规律, 把相似的归为一类

### Cocktail Party Algorithm
find structure in a chaotic environment, 在混乱的数据里面找到独立的成分/结构
