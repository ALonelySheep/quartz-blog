**Ad hoc** is a Latin phrase meaning literally '**to this**'. In English, it typically signifies a solution for a specific purpose, problem, or task rather than a generalized solution adaptable to collateral instances. (Compare with a priori.)

Common examples are ad hoc committees and commissions created at the national or international level for a specific task. In other fields the term could refer to, for example, a military unit created under special circumstances (see task force), a tailor-made suit, a handcrafted network protocol (e.g., ad hoc network), a temporary banding together of geographically-linked franchise locations (of a given national brand) to issue advertising coupons, or a purpose-specific equation.
