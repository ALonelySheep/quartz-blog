《奥德赛》（古希腊语：Ὀδύσσεια，转写：Odýsseia，英语：Odyssey）是古希腊最重要的两部史诗之一（另一部是《伊利亚特》）。《奥德赛》延续了《伊利亚特》的故事情节，由盲诗人荷马所作。这部史诗是西方文学的奠基之作，是除《伊利亚特》外现存最古老的西方文学作品。

It follows the Greek hero Odysseus, king of Ithaca, and his journey home after the Trojan War. After the war itself, which lasted ten years, his journey lasted for ten additional years, during which time he encountered many perils and all his crew mates were killed. In his absence, Odysseus was assumed dead, and his wife Penelope and son Telemachus had to contend with a group of unruly suitors who were competing for Penelope's hand in marriage.
