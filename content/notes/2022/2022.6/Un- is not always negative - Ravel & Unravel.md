[When 'Un-' Isn't Negative | Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/when-un-isnt-negative)

> These are three instances in which a verb beginning with _un-_ means the same as, rather than the negative or opposite of, its stem.
> 
> And while it might seem frustratingly illogical when you are used to regarding un- strictly as a negative prefix, this use of _un-_ isn't as irrational as it looks.
> 
> In all three cases—_unthaw_, _unloosen_, and _unravel_—the _un-_ form of the verb came into being only after its stem was already established in English.
> 
> And in all three cases, notably, the verb stem already connotes some kind of undoing, an action of removing something from a state that had existed (frozenness, knottedness, intactness).
> 
> Rather than negating each action, the placement of _un-_ in front of these verb stems seems to reinforce the undoing action of each—thereby _emphasizing_ the idea of negation rather than serving to negate the verb stem itself.

> ravel  
> 1582, "to untangle, unwind," also "to become tangled or confused" (1585), from Du. ravelen "to tangle, fray, unweave," from rafel "frayed thread." **The seemingly contradictory senses of this word (ravel and unravel are both synonyms and antonyms) are reconciled by its roots in weaving and sewing: as threads become unwoven, they get tangled.**
