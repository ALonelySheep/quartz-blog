## [什么是数据不均衡](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/data-prep/construct/sampling-splitting/imbalanced-data)
- A classification data set with skewed class proportions is called **imbalanced**. Classes that make up a large proportion of the data set are called **majority classes**. Those that make up a smaller proportion are **minority classes**.

What counts as imbalanced? The answer could range from mild to extreme, as the table below shows.

| Degree of imbalance | Proportion of Minority Class |
| ------ | ------ | 
| Mild |   20-40% of the data set| 
| Moderate |   1-20% of the data set| 
| Extreme |   <1% of the data set|
