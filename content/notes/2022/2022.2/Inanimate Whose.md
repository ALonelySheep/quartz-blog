- **我们可以用Whose指代不是人的动物, 也可以用于非生命的物体(Inanimate Whose[^1]就是这种情况).**
	- 例句: 
		That's the car _whose_ alarm keeps waking us up at night.

- **如果不想用Whose, 也有以下方法来等价代换:** 
	- 使用 *of which*
		> - He was watching the movie *whose* title I couldn’t remember earlier.
		> - He was watching the movie, the title *of which* I couldn’t remember earlier.  
		> - The car *whose* windshield is cracked is his.  
		> - The car, the windshield *of which* is cracked, is his.
		- 然而这样的句子读起来clumsy or stilted.
	
	- 也可以避免使用所有格, 比如使用*with*
		> - He was watching the movie with the title that I couldn't remember earlier. 
		> - The car with the cracked windshield is his.

- 然而在**疑问句里面**, 使用Whose指代非生命的物体会带来歧义: 
	- "*Whose* lid is this?"
	- "*Which* container does this lid *belong to*?"
